# Automotive CAN Bus Simulator ðŸš—ðŸ“¡

This project simulates automotive ECU traffic on a Controller Area Network (CAN Bus) using a microcontroller (STM32/ESP32/Arduino Due) and CAN transceiver modules. It was built as a resume project to demonstrate embedded systems design, real-time firmware, and CAN protocol handling.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Simulate 2â€“3 virtual ECUs (e.g. Engine, Braking, Cluster)
- Transmit realistic CAN frames (RPM, Speed, Brake Status)
- Support interactive driving scenarios (Idle, Braking, Cruising, Fault)
- Build PC-based CAN monitor (Python)
- Add error injection and fault simulation (stretch)
